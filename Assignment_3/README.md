After ensuring all of the above, you can run the programme as such:
```bash
$ python3 Assignment_2.py
```

## Output
As an output you will get 3 files: error.txt, successrate.txt and truePositives.txt.

The file error.txt shows the error of the training data and the test data for each iteration.

The file successrate.txt shows the success rate of the training data and the test data for each interation.

The file truePositives.txt shows the true positives rate of the training data and the test data for each interation.

Also, the graphical representation of each file will be displayed.
