# Assignment 1

The assignment called for creating an artificial neural network that can predict the output of an XOR logical gate.

## Usage

You should make sure you have installed: python3,numpy and matplotlib.

Next, in the same folder have the python file (Assignment_1.py), the paramters file (parameters.txt), the training data file (training.txt) and the test data file (test.txt).

After ensuring all of the above, you can run the programme as such:
```bash
$ python3 Assignment_1.py
```

## Output
As an output you will get 2 files: error.txt and successrate.txt.

The file error.txt shows the error of the training data and the test data for each iteration.

The file successrate.txt shows the success rate of the training data and the test data for each interation.

Also, the graphical representation of each file will be displayed.
